## 🧠 Project Overview

**NoteNinja AI** is a personalized learning assistant designed to help students interact with their lecture notes, PDFs, and quizzes in a conversational manner. It leverages the power of **transformer-based models** (like Flan-T5), integrated via **LangChain**, to deliver smart, context-aware answers — almost like having a private tutor powered by AI.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **LangChain** – Orchestrates the logic between document loaders, retrievers, and LLMs  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – Used Flan-T5 model for natural language understanding  
- **Streamlit** – Deployed a simple, interactive frontend  
- **Google Colab** – Used for initial development and prototyping  
- **PDF/Text Parsing** – Supports academic notes and quizzes

## ⚠️ Project Status

> 🚧 Due to some recent system issues, the **main source code and components have been temporarily removed** from the repository.  
> We are actively working on **rebuilding and restoring** the project components.

🔧 Expect updates soon with a working version, complete with code, documentation, and deployment instructions.
